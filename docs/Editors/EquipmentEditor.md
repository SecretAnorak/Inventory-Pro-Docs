The equipment system is very flexible and can be used for almost any equip / attachment system. Equip types can be restricted to avoid certain combinations.

For example when equipping a 1H sword, I made sure a 2H sword and 2H axe and a Dagger are not compatible.

When a sword is equipped while a dagger is equipped, the dagger will be unequipped.
