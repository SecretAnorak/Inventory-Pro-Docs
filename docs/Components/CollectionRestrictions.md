# Collection Restrictions

For more control per collection you can filter items. For example, you might want to create a collection that only allows consumable items, or a collection that only allows items below rarity Unique.

Type restrictions are prioritized over the “Loot priority”. In other words, if you have an inventory with a lower priority, but with a type restriction that allows the object to be placed, the type restricted collection will always be chosen first, regardless of “Loot priority”.

The restriction can settings can be found at the bottom of any collection.
