# Bank

The `BankUI`, as the name implies, allows the user to store items in the bank, and remove them whenever they please. Just like any other collection the bank can store currencies.

- **Use move to inventory:**  When an item inside the bank is "used" by for example clicking it, it will be moved to the player's inventory instead of actually being used.
