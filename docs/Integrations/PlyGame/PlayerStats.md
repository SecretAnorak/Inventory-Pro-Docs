Inside the equipment editor (**Tools/Inventory Pro/Main editor** â€“ Equip editor tab) you can define which ply attributes are shown inside the character window.

When there is a plyGame stat and a item property with the same name, the item property will be leading; Meaning that all the starting values such as base value will be taken from the item property. The stats can be accessed like regular Inventory Pro stats by grabbing them from the character collection.
