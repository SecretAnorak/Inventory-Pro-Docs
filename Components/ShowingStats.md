# Showing stats

The StatUI component allows you to show a stat from either the current or a specific player on the screen. The stat can be visualized in a few different ways using the Visualizer.

## The visualizer

The visualizer, as seen at the bottom, as several options to visualize a value.

**Text**  allows you to display the stat as regular text using a specific format.

**Sliders**  are very useful when you want to visualize a health bar. Of course, this can be used in par with the text field to create a health bar with its value inside.

**Image fill** is a Unity UI image effect that can be used to gradually "fill" an image using visual effects.

**Audio** The audio played whenever an action is finalized. For example, when holding a key to confirm an action the activation clip will be played.
